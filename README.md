## Description

Incredibly exciting console math games are waiting for you right after installation.


## How to install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dushnila/frontend-project-44.git
```
After cloning, go to the package directory and run the command:
```bash
make install
```
Install globall (you can run games anywhere from the command line):

```bash
sudo npm link
```

## How to play

After installing the package, use the commands located in the project directory:

```bash
make brain-even
``` 
Answer "yes" if the number is even, otherwise answer "no".  
<br /><br />
```bash
make brain-calc
``` 
What is the result of the expression? 
  
<br /><br />  
```bash
make brain-gcd
``` 
Find the greatest common divisor of given numbers.  
<br /><br />

```bash
make brain-prime
``` 
Answer "yes" if given number is prime. Otherwise answer "no". 

<br /><br /> 
```bash
make brain-progression
``` 
What number is missing in the progression?
<br /><br />

If the package was installed globally (with "npm link"), then it can be run anywhere without using "make", for example:

```bash
brain-progression
```
